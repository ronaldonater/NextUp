## What it does

The bot creates and manages osu! multiplayer lobbies through Bancho. It rotates host turns automatically, keeps local competitive records for every game mode, validates selected beatmaps against configurable regulations, and provides a browser-based control panel at <code>http://localhost:3000</code>.

| Lobby flow | Competitive play | Dashboard |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Queue-based host rotation | Per-mode ELO and player statistics | Create and manage multiple lobbies |
| Five-minute map-pick and start timers | Fractional placement ELO with dynamic K-factor | Configure regulations before or after creation |
| Voting for skip, start, abort, and kick | Global best-score and leaderboard notices | Browse player stats and activity logs |
| Optional random Team VS events | Local and global leaderboards | Edit names, passwords, ranked state, and more |

## Quick start

### Requirements

- Node.js 22 or newer
- An osu! OAuth application
- A dedicated osu! account for the Bancho bot
- A legacy osu! API key, required by bancho.js

### Install and configure

~~~sh
npm install
Copy-Item .env.example .env
~~~

Open <code>.env</code> and set your credentials:

~~~dotenv
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
OSU_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
OSU_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
BANCHO_USERNAME="your_bot_username"
BANCHO_PASSWORD="your_bot_password"
BANCHO_API_KEY="your_legacy_api_key"
DASHBOARD_TOKEN="a_long_random_secret"
ADMIN_OSU_IDS="your_osu_profile_id"
PORT=3000
~~~

<code>ADMIN_OSU_IDS</code> uses numeric osu! profile IDs, separated by commas when you need more than one administrator.

### Start the bot

~~~sh
npm run db:generate
npm run db:migrate
npm run dev
~~~

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), enter the <code>DASHBOARD_TOKEN</code> from your <code>.env</code>, and create a lobby. For a production-style build, use:

~~~sh
npm run build
npm start
~~~

## Local dashboard

The dashboard is the simplest way to create a room and apply its starting rules before anybody joins. It supports:

- Lobby title, optional password, game mode, team mode, and win condition
- Map-star, length, BPM, AR, HP, OD, CS, map-status, and year regulations
- Ranked or unranked lobbies, Free Mod, map conversion settings, and random-event chance
- Active-lobby editing, room closure, optional inactive-room recreation, and a per-lobby activity console
- Per-mode player lookup, player-stat editing, and paginated ELO leaderboards

The dashboard HTML, CSS, and client script live in [public/](public).

## Commands

Commands are case-insensitive. Username parameters can include spaces, and <code>mode</code> accepts <code>osu</code>, <code>taiko</code>, <code>catch</code>, or <code>mania</code>. Players can also use <code>!cmds</code> in a lobby to receive the web reference:

## ELO and match records

Ranked Head-to-Head games use fractional placement ELO. All finishers receive a result based on placement, tied scores share an averaged rank, and disconnects tie for last. Ratings are compared with the lobby's average ELO.

| Matches played before the game | K-factor |
| --- | ---: |
| 0–10 | 40 |
| 11–100 | 24 |
| 101+ | 16 |

Each game mode maintains its own ELO and stats. A player must complete at least three matches to appear on ELO leaderboards, though ratings continue updating before then. One-player games and random events are unranked and do not change ELO or competitive statistics.

## Scripts

| <code>npm start</code> | Run the compiled build |
| <code>npm test</code> | Build and run ELO tests |

## Notes for public deployment

Use a dedicated bot account and keep its credentials and dashboard token private. For a remote deployment, use a durable database such as PostgreSQL, serve the dashboard behind TLS, and configure reconnect and recovery behavior appropriate for your host.

The local dashboard theme is adapted from [Stern](https://github.com/osuTitanic/titanic/tree/main/services/stern), inspired by the classic osu! website.
